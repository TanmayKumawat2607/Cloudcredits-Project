Machine learning project 

Project 1:House_Price_prediction
ðŸ“Œ Objective: Predict house prices based on features like size, location,bhk,bath.  
â€¢ Dataset: Jaipur Housing dataset(own modified).  
â€¢ Algorithm: Linear Regression.  
â€¢ Evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² score. 
â€¢Features Used for Prediction: Total Square Feet,Number of Bathrooms,Number of BHKs (Bedrooms-Hall-Kitchen),Location.
â€¢Output: Predicted house price in Lakh Rupees (â‚¹).
â€¢Add on Feature: Includes a GUI built using Tkinter for interactive prediction.

Project 2:Iris_flower_prediction
ðŸ“Œ Objective:Classify iris flowers into three species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica â€” based on their sepal and petal length and width.
â€¢Dataset: The classic Iris Dataset. 
â€¢Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression or Decision Tree. 
â€¢Evaluation: Accuracy,Confusion Matrix. 
â€¢Features Used:Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
â€¢Output: Predicted species name based on user input.
â€¢Add on Feature: Includes a Tkinter GUI to interactively input flower measurements and get predictions.
